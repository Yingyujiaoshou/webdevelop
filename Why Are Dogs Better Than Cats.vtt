00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:05.170
We live in a fast-paced world, which demands
our attention and can easily wear us out.

2
00:00:05.170 --> 00:00:09.200
There are many ways to reduce the stress that
daily life brings, and one of the best ways

3
00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:10.590
is to own a pet.

4
00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:14.850
A pet constantly gives love and gratitude,
they can provide entertainment, and they’re

5
00:00:14.850 --> 00:00:16.900
happy just being in your presence.

6
00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:21.570
With so many different types of pets to choose
from - whether its fish, birds, rabbits, or

7
00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:26.050
gerbils - the decision could be overwhelming,
but today we’re going to focus on the two

8
00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:31.509
most beloved domesticated animals on the planet,
in this episode of the The Infographics Show:

9
00:00:31.509 --> 00:00:33.390
Dogs vs Cats.

10
00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:39.300
According to a 2013 Live Science report, freshwater
fish are the most common pet with 142 million

11
00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:42.290
freshwater fish owned as pets around the world.

12
00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:48.340
Cats come in second at 88.3 million, and dogs
close behind at 74.8 million.

13
00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:52.690
But let’s face it; if your reason for wanting
a pet is fun and companionship, then you’re

14
00:00:52.690 --> 00:00:54.829
likely looking for either a cat or dog.

15
00:00:54.829 --> 00:00:59.320
Which you chose will come down to your personality,
the time you have to dedicate to your new

16
00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:02.310
friend, and the space you have to house your
pet.

17
00:01:02.310 --> 00:01:07.060
Cats are more independent and generally less
demanding, whereas dogs are loyal and obedient

18
00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:10.929
but require more attention and exercise, including
regular walks.

19
00:01:10.929 --> 00:01:15.000
Dogs live between 12 to 18 years and cats
can live as old as 25.

20
00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:20.799
That’s 25 human years, but in cat years
that’s the grand old age of 116!

21
00:01:20.799 --> 00:01:24.979
Looking back in time at these canine and feline
rivals, British newspaper, The Independent,

22
00:01:24.979 --> 00:01:29.640
published information from a groundbreaking
study of 2,000 ancient fossils of dogs and

23
00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:30.640
cats.

24
00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:34.640
The study revealed that the cat family has
historically been much better at surviving

25
00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:38.210
than the dog clan, and often at the latter’s
expense.

26
00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:43.689
The study showed that cats have played a major
role in making 40 dog species extinct, outcompeting

27
00:01:43.689 --> 00:01:48.240
them for scarce food supplies because they
are generally more effective hunters.

28
00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:52.039
And there was no evidence that dogs have wiped
out a single cat species.

29
00:01:52.039 --> 00:01:56.649
That’s sure to anger you dog lovers, but
that was long in the past and nearly all of

30
00:01:56.649 --> 00:02:01.140
todays dogs and cats are domesticated, which
is why we love to spend time with them.

31
00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:05.299
So if you’re in the market for a pet, how
do you choose between a feline friend or canine

32
00:02:05.299 --> 00:02:06.299
companion?

33
00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:07.560
Let’s see if we can help.

34
00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:11.390
First, it’s good to consider how much time
you can dedicate to your pet.

35
00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:15.080
Dogs require more time than cats, and they
don’t like to be left home alone.

36
00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:16.720
Both come with different price tags.

37
00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:20.580
Dogs are more expensive than cats, but there’s
always the option of visiting the pound and

38
00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:22.580
taking on a rescue animal.

39
00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:27.300
Some cats live their life indoors and require
a litter tray, whereas others will stay out,

40
00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:29.020
only coming in for food.

41
00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:31.890
When choosing a dog, consider its size.

42
00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:36.710
Larger dogs, like German Shepherds or Labradors,
need more space and cost more to feed.

43
00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:40.410
And when it comes to mood, dogs are more needy
and affectionate.

44
00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:44.300
Cats on the other hand are more independent,
though it varies by breed.

45
00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:49.410
For example, Siamese cats are intelligent
and playful, but can be noisy, while longhaired

46
00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:53.170
cats are laid back and shorthaired cats are
generally affectionate.

47
00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:57.900
And as individuals, both cats and dogs have
different personalities, so interact with

48
00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:01.270
them before taking them home to see if you
can be buddies.

49
00:03:01.270 --> 00:03:04.760
That might help you choose, but there’s
more to take in to account when your pet joins

50
00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:05.760
you at home.

51
00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:09.730
What about other considerations of day-to-day
life with your new dog or cat?

52
00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:14.190
Feeding - Animals all need feeding and because
you’ll be feeding them, they’ll be your

53
00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:15.190
BFF.

54
00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:19.590
The amount a cat needs to eat varies depending
on its size, but cats require less food than

55
00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:23.931
pretty much all dogs, unless you’re shopping
for one of those tiny little toy dogs, that

56
00:03:23.931 --> 00:03:26.460
some folks carry around in their handbag.

57
00:03:26.460 --> 00:03:32.210
Cat food comes in dry or canned wet form and
adult cats require between 250 and 300 calories

58
00:03:32.210 --> 00:03:33.210
per day.

59
00:03:33.210 --> 00:03:37.920
You can also feed your cat fish, such as canned
tuna, as a treat now and then, but if it makes

60
00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:42.020
up a large part of their diet, they are at
risk of thiamine deficiency.

61
00:03:42.020 --> 00:03:44.530
How much a dog eats depends on its size.

62
00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:49.400
Commercial dog food comes in both dry and
wet forms, and most dogs need between 25 and

63
00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:52.060
30 calories per pound per day.

64
00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:56.330
Dogs of course love bones but don’t give
your dog cooked bones because cooked bones

65
00:03:56.330 --> 00:03:59.100
may splinter and injure their intestines.

66
00:03:59.100 --> 00:04:01.540
And another danger food for dogs is chocolate.

67
00:04:01.540 --> 00:04:06.040
For humans, it’s a pleasurable treat but
it can poison a dog.

68
00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:11.151
Grooming - Cats famously do not like water,
but luckily they do not need bathing, though

69
00:04:11.151 --> 00:04:14.840
they should be brushed regularly, especially
if they have long hair.

70
00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:19.200
Most cats enjoy the activity as it relieves
any itchiness, particularly during the hot

71
00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:20.200
months.

72
00:04:20.200 --> 00:04:25.340
As for dogs, they need grooming and bathing
regularly, especially those with long hair.

73
00:04:25.340 --> 00:04:30.010
In the summer, dogs will shed and lose their
coat, so grooming aids this process, and if

74
00:04:30.010 --> 00:04:33.810
you don’t take the time to clean your dog,
he or she will soon start to stink up your

75
00:04:33.810 --> 00:04:35.350
entire house.

76
00:04:35.350 --> 00:04:40.230
Health & Hygiene - Both cats and dogs can
get infected with ticks, lice, fleas and other

77
00:04:40.230 --> 00:04:41.230
parasites.

78
00:04:41.230 --> 00:04:45.380
When this happens, disinfectants like Frontline
or Advantix are required to clear the pet

79
00:04:45.380 --> 00:04:50.370
of infection, though Advantix is used only
on dogs because it is very dangerous for cats.

80
00:04:50.370 --> 00:04:54.070
Frequent grooming and bathing will help to
avoid these outbreaks, as will visiting the

81
00:04:54.070 --> 00:04:58.650
vet regularly, to ensure the pets injections
are up to date and other health checkups are

82
00:04:58.650 --> 00:04:59.980
carried out.

83
00:04:59.980 --> 00:05:03.500
House Training - Cats can easily be trained
to use their litter-box.

84
00:05:03.500 --> 00:05:05.380
This requires cleaning once a day.

85
00:05:05.380 --> 00:05:08.790
But other than that, they tend to keep themselves
to themselves.

86
00:05:08.790 --> 00:05:13.200
A dog on the other hand, needs to be trained,
socialized, and housebroken.

87
00:05:13.200 --> 00:05:17.280
Training usually takes around 2 months and
according to The Dog Whisperer, Cesar Milan,

88
00:05:17.280 --> 00:05:23.150
the 5 essential commands your dog must learn
are sit, come, down, stay, and leave it.

89
00:05:23.150 --> 00:05:27.240
At the end og the day, dogs are for some people
and cats for others.

90
00:05:27.240 --> 00:05:30.940
If you spend a lot of time away from home,
then maybe a cat is best, but if you have

91
00:05:30.940 --> 00:05:34.810
a big house and yard and like a pet to stand
guard, then you’re probably more suited

92
00:05:34.810 --> 00:05:36.090
to own a dog.

93
00:05:36.090 --> 00:05:38.810
So, what’s your pet of choice and why?
