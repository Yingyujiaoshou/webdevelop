    <h1>The meaning of animal movements</h1>
  <h2>clip from NYT</h2>
    <p>Last fall, teams of scientists fanned out across the globe to outfit thousands of creatures — rhinos in South Africa, blackbirds in France, fruit bats in Zambia — with small tracking devices. The data they collect will stream into an ambitious new project, known as ICARUS, that will allow scientists to observe animal movements in near totality for the first time.

The scale and meaning of animal movements has been underestimated for decades. Evidence has emerged that animals move farther than we knew, and those movements contain important information about adaptations to habitat loss and disease spread.</p>
